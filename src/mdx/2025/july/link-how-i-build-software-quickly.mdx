I recently stumbled upon [this blog post titled "How I build software quickly"](https://evanhahn.com/how-i-build-software-quickly/) from <Abbr title="HackerNews">the orange site</Abbr>.

I highly recommend giving the whole post a read, but these two points really stood out to me:

> **Build “top to bottom”.** For example, in an application, I prefer to scaffold the UI before the business logic, even if lots of stuff is hard-coded. I’ve sometimes written business logic *first*, which I later discarded once the UI came into play, because I miscalculated how it would be used. Build the top layer first—the “dream code” I want to write or the API I wish existed—rather than trying to build the “bottom” layer first. It’s easier to make the right API decisions when I start with how it will be used. It can also be easier to gather feedback on.
> 
> **Extract smaller changes while working.** Sometimes, during a rough draft, I realize that some improvement needs to be made elsewhere in the code. Maybe there’s a dependency that needs updating. Before finishing the final draft, make a separate patch to just update that dependency. This is useful on its own *and* will benefit the upcoming change. I can push it for code review separately, and hopefully, it’ll be merged by the time I finish my final draft.

The first point aligns well with my ["vertical slice" methodology](/2025/february/youre-building-software-wrong), and the second is something I've been trying to improve upon in my own development process over the past year or so!
