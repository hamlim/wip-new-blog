Yet another year has passed since [my last birthday post](/2024/july/30), and as always the year seemed to fly by incredibly quickly!

In the past year I've:

- Changed jobs (_yes, again_, from Fireworks to HubSpot)
- Published a few new blog posts ‚úçÔ∏è
- Got engaged! üíç
- [launched a podcast with my friends](https://bikeshedpod.com/) üéôÔ∏è
- [redesigned / rewrote my personal website](/2025/may/website-redesign-v10)

## Recap:

As usual, I want to revisit the goals that I set for myself in my previous birthday post:

- Get serious about my health
- Build more
- [REDACTED]

I think this year was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of my goals, lets dig in!

### Get serious about my health ü´§

Without looking at the data yet (which I'll get to below), I feel like I regressed a bit here rather than getting healthier. It's been something that I've been thinking about more actively for the past month or so - and I hope I can keep up that mindset.

### Build more ü´§

Although I roughly had ~2200 GitHub contributions over the past year, I feel like I dropped off around the holidays and then tried to pick it back up since the spring of this year.

Increasingly I'm finding it difficult to get motivation to work on side projects, I think part of that is that before I was working closely to some of the things I want to do as side projects, but now my work is a bit different from some of my side projects.

Additionally with AI and the advent of <Abbr title="Agentic Development Environments">ADE's</Abbr> like Claude Code or Cursor, [I've lost a bit of interest in writing code outside of work](/2025/january/the-ai-development-conundrum).

I had the goal of launching 2 projects this year, but I unfortunately didn't do that this year.

### [REDACTED]

If you couldn't tell, this goal was to ask Katie to marry me - and she said yes!

## Goals:

Looking forward for the next year I want to tackle the following:

### Health

While this has been a recurring goal for the past [two](/2024/july/30) [years](/2023/july/29), one key aspect I want to get better at is monitoring the food I eat on top of my steps and weight. At the moment I'm using [Cronometer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-cronometer/id1145935738) to track my food - the problem I think I'll eventually run into is how to track food from restaurants or on the go.

I may look at building something for this since I'm not a huge fan of the various ads within the app at the moment and I'm not sure I want to pay monthly for it either.

### Read more

Over the past year or so I've been reading a lot more books than I had in previous years, I'm hoping that I can continue reading often. I don't really have any data backing it up at the moment but I think that I've picked up my reading pace as well.

This past year I have read approximately 15 books I think - check my [bookshelf](/bookshelf) to see what they were!

### Write more

I have a backlog of 56 blog post ideas in my vault at the moment, while I don't want to set any specific goal on the number of posts I do generally want to write more posts, and hopefully burn down that list a bit more!
